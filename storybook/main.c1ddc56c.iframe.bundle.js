Always define the exact version you want to use, and test for breaking changes before upgrading to a newer alpha release.**\n\nApplying design elements from this project is strictly prohibited for organisations that are not part of the Municipality of Utrecht.\n\nThis project is part of a community iniative to use NL Design System components for projects that need to adhere to the Utrecht Design System. Teams from the central Municipality of Utrecht, as well as those who are contracted by them to develop websites and apps, are able to collaborate via this project.\n\n## Getting started\n\nInclude the Design Token CSS variables:\n\n```html\n<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://unpkg.com/@utrecht/design-tokens/dist/index.css" />\n```\n\nCombine it with the latest Web Components from the NL Design System community, for example:\n\n```html\n<script\n  src="https://unpkg.com/@utrecht/web-component-library-stencil/dist/utrecht/utrecht.esm.js"\n  type="module"\n><\/script>\n```\n\nThen you can go ahead and see the result:\n\n```html\n<utrecht-html-content>\n  <h1>Page styled with NL Design System</h1>\n</utrecht-html-content>\n```\n\n### Avoid automatic upgrades to a new version with breaking changes\n\nFor all dependencies, see what the version is you use while developing and update the URL without version to include a version number, and ensure your page keeps working even when new versions are released:\n\nFor _alpha_, _beta_ and _rc_ versions:\n\n```text\nhttps://unpkg.com/@utrecht/design-tokens/dist/index.css\n```\n\nAbove should become:\n\n```text\nhttps://unpkg.com/@utrecht/design-tokens@1.0.0-alpha.10/dist/index.css\n```\n\nFor stable versions it would become:\n\n```text\nhttps://unpkg.com/@utrecht/design-tokens@^1.0.0/dist/index.css\n```\n\n## npm packages\n\n| name

Deze eis beschrijft dat als een link de focus door het te selecteren met het toetsenbord het uiterlijk van de link moet veranderen. De [bedoeling van dit punt](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-appearance-minimum.html#intent) is dat de keyboard focus indicator altijd duidelijk zichtbaar is.\n\n### Design keuzes\n\nWe maken daarom de volgende design keuzes bij een hover state:\n\n- Een link in focus state krijgt een gele achtergrondkleur (`var(--utrecht-yellow-60)`).\n- Een link in focus state krijgt een donkerblauwe outline (`var(--utrecht-blue-35)`).\n- We kiezen voor outline in plaats van border omdat dit beter opgepakt wordt door de verschillende browsers.\n\nAls een link de focus krijgt is deze een stuk zichtbaarder dan zonder deze achtergrond. Het verschil tussen de normale achtergrond (zonder focus) en de nieuwe achtergrond (met focus) moet voldoen aan een contrast ration van 3:1.

Een gebruiker moet zonder moeite kunnen voorspellen wat er gebeurt als hij op een button drukt. De tekst op een button moet daarom overdreven duidelijk zijn.\n\nDe tekst in een button moet beginnen met een duidelijk werkwoord dat vraagt om actie. Om gebruikers context te geven zodat ze weten wat een button gat doen, kan je de volgende formule gebruken: {werkwoord} + {zelfstandig naamwoord}. Een uitzondering hier op zijn generieke acties, zoals "Sluiten", "Cancel" of "OK".\n\nDe tekst in buttons begint altijd met een hoofdletter. Als er meerdere woorden in een button staan heeft alleen de eerste letter van het eerste woord een hoofdletter.\n\nProbeer lidwoorden te vermijden.\n\n## Do\n\n- Buttons moeten een duidelijke en precieze tekst hebben.\n- Gebruik een duidelijk werkwoord in de tekst die een actie aangeeft.\n- Buttons moeten de juiste kleur in de juiste context hebben. Gebruik alleen een afwijkende kleur als een actie bijvoorbeeld onomkeerbaar is.\n- Probeer zo min mogelijk buttons te gebruiker op één pagina. Teveel opties hebben is verwarrend voor de gebruiker.\n- Zorg dat buttons consistent op dezelfde plek staan over verschillende pagina\'s heen.\n\n## Don\'ts\n\n- Zorg dat de gebruikers nooit moeten gokken wat een button doet, zeker als de actie van de button onomkeerbaar is.\n- Gebruik buttons nooit als navigatie, gebruik daar links voor.\n- Zorg dat button tekst nooit langer is dan 1 regel.\n\n## Buttons versus links\n\nGebruik buttons voor acties. Bijvoorbeeld "Toevoegen", "Sluiten", "Annuleren" of "Opslaan."

When a user did not configure their system to always make focus visible using for example a focus ring, the user should be able to know which component will be activated when pressing the `Enter` key. When focus and hover state look similar, it might not possible to know which element would be activated.\n- When using color, use a consistent color to convey focus. Choose a color that can be combined with other states, such as combining the red color for invalid state with your color for focus state.\n- When changing the `font-weight` of a component as focus state, it might cause unintended layout shifts, so it might not be the ideal option.\n\n## Design for `:focus-visible`\n\n- A focus ring should not obscure the content inside the focused area.\n- A focus ring should not obscure surrounding content. This consideration can also affect the minimum space between focusable elements.\n- A focus ring should be visible with sufficient contrast on both dark and light backgrounds.\n- A focus ring should be visible on backgrounds with unknown and mixed colors, such as background images.\n- When using CSS with `overflow: hidden` in your component, the `outline` rendering can become partially or completely invisible. Be careful not to break the focus indication when using `overflow: hidden`.\n\n## Related reading\n\n- [Giving users and developers more control over focus - Chromium Blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/09/giving-users-and-developers-more.html)\n- [The Focus-Indicated Pseudo-class: `:focus-visible` - W3C Selectors specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#the-focus-visible-pseudo)\n- [Understanding WCAG Success Criterion 2.4.7: Focus visible](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible.html)\n"},"../../components/custom-checkbox/README.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports="\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# Custom Checkbox\n"},"../../components/custom-checkbox/design.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports="\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n\x3c!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 --\x3e\n\n## Design\n\n[Figma - Utrecht Design System - Checkbox](https://www.figma.com/file/msb3CfQBefPoruqNQ968Zh/Utrecht-Design-System?node-id=302%3A3302)\n"},"../../components/digid-button/README.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports="\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# DigiD button\n"},"../../components/document/README.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports="\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# Document root\n"},"../../components/emphasis/README.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports="\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# Emphasis\n"},"../../components/favicon/README.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports="\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# Favicon\n"},"../../components/form-field-checkbox-group/README.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports="\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# Form field with checkbox group\n"},"../../components/form-field-checkbox/README.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports="\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# Form field with checkbox\n\n## Introduction\n\nCheckboxes are usually used to provide a way for users to make a range of selections (zero, one or more).

Elk icoon is beschikbaar als custom element. De naam van van het icoon (`utrecht-icon-...`) is ook de naam van het custom-element. Voorbeeld:\n\n```html\n<div>\n  <utrecht-icon-loupe></utrecht-icon-loupe>\n</div>\n```\n\nVerander de kleur van het icoon via de CSS-eigenschap `color` op een parent element of via de custom eigenschap `--utrecht-icon-color`.\n\n### `color` van de omgevings content\n\nOp onderstaande manier kan je het makkelijkst de kleur aanpassen. De kleur van de bestaande tekst zal ook op het icoon toegepast worden.\n\n```html\n<button>\n  <utrecht-icon-loupe></utrecht-icon-loupe>\n  Search\n</button>\n\n<style>\n  button {\n    background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\n    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\n  }\n</style>\n```\n\n### `--utrecht-icon-color` als custom icoon kleur\n\nDeze manier is handig als je een klein verschil wilt aanbrengen tussen de tekst kleur en de kleur van het icoon. Het gebruikt een CSS custom property `--utrecht-icon-color` als de kleur van het icoon.\n\n```html\n<button>\n  <utrecht-icon-loupe></utrecht-icon-loupe>\n  Search\n</button>\n\n<style>\n  button {\n    --utrecht-icon-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);\n    background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\n    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\n  }\n</style>\n```\n\n### Icoon grootte aanpassen\n\nDe grootte van het icoon kan aangepast worden met de `--utrecht-icon-size` CSS eigenschap:\n\n```html\n<button>\n  <utrecht-icon-loupe></utrecht-icon-loupe>\n  Search\n</button>\n\n<style>\n  button {\n    --utrecht-icon-size: 42px;\n    background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\n    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\n  }\n</style>\n```\n"},"../../components/icon/UXguidelines.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports="\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# UX Guidelines\n\n## Het nut van iconen\n\n- Iconen kunnen een gemeenschappelijke visuele taal zijn die een taalkloof overbrugt.\n- Iconen geven visuele feedback (plaatje zegt vaak meer dan tekst).\n- Iconen vergroten visuele interesse zodat het de aandacht trekt van de gebruiker.\n\nJe kan dus met iconen de bezoekers helpen navigeren of de de aandacht vestigen op een bepaald onderdeel van een pagina.\n\n## Combinatie van icoon en tekst\n\nCombineer waar mogelijk een icoon met tekst.\n\nHet kan zijn dat een bezoeker een icoon niet helemaal goed begrijpt. Het gebruik van tekst (label) is ook een belangrijke factor in de navigatie. Een eenvoudig en duidelijk icoon met een goed omschreven label is superieur aan iconen of labels alleen.\n\n## Niet teveel iconen op een pagina\n\nTe veel iconen gebruiken op een pagina kan een soort blindheid veroorzaken.\n\nLet er op dat er niet te veel iconen op een pagina komen te staan en voorkom een oerwoud van plaatjes. Bij het gebruik van te veel iconen worden de iconen niets meer dan decoratie op je pagina en mist het z’n doel als navigatiehulp voor de bezoeker.\n\nDoor het aantal iconen te beperken, trekken de iconene die je wel gebruikt sneller de aandacht van de gebruiker en wordt het navigeren op de pagina eenvoudiger.\n\nDe uitstraling van iconen hebben een effect op de vormgeving van de portaal/webpagina.

Gebruikers moeten een duidelijke verwachting hebben wat er gebeurt als er interactie is met een link d.m.v. een muis, vinger, spraak of ogen.\n\nGebruikers met ondersteunende technologie, zoals een schermlezer of braillebalk, horen/voelen vaak als eerste alle links in de content om hen te helpen snel te kunnen navigeren door de content. Er kan ook behoefte zijn om de de content vergroot te willen bekijken, zodat de gebruikers alleen de linktekst en een paar woorden eromheen tegelijkertijd kan zien.\n\nVermijd onduidelijke tekten in een link zoals 'hier' of 'lees meer' als link tekst hebben.\n\n### Links in een zin\n\nLinks moeten nooit een hele zin in beslag nemen, maar alleen de tekst die beschrijft waar de gebruikers naar toe gaan als ze op de link klikken.\n\n### Buttons versus links\n\nLinks worden vooral gebruikt om te navigeren en verschijnen dan ook in of direct na een zin.\n\nButtons worden gebruikt voor acties, zoals 'toevoegen', 'sluiten' of 'opslaan'.\n\n### Do's\n\n- Plaats links aan het einde van een zin als dat mogelijk is.\n- Maak duidelijk waar de link je naar toe brengt.\n- Gebruik het meest relevante woord van de link aan het begin van de link tekst. Bezoekers lezen niet verder dan de eerste twee woorden van een link.\n- Zorg dat de link ook begrijpelijk is zonder dat je de zinnen er omheen gelezen hebt.\n\n### Don'ts\n\n- Gebruik geen buttons waar je een link kan gebruiken.\n- Gebruik geen vage of te algemene termen voor de link tekst. Help de gebruiker met voorspellen waar hij naar toe gaat.\n- Open interne links niet in een nieuwe tab.

Hierdoor hoeven ze niet precies op de link te staan met de muis en kunnen ze dus sneller naar de pagina waar ze naar toe willen.\n\n## 1.3 UX richtlijnen\n\n### 1.3.1 Wanneer gebruik je dit component?\n\nJe gebruikt dit component om...\n\n- ...de gebruiker overzicht te geven en te helpen navigeren door _een site_ met een diepte van één tot drie lagen.\n- ...de gebruiker overzicht te geven en te helpen navigeren door _een gedeelte van een site_ met een diepte van één tot drie lagen.\n\n### 1.3.2 Alternatieven en gerelateerde componenten\n\nJe kan beter kijken naar een alternatief als...\n\n- ...het om een kleine site gaat met minder dan vijf pagina\'s. Probeer de site dan horizontaal in te delen zonder navigatie hierarchie. Het Top-nav component biedt dan uitkomst.\n- ...het toevoegen van een sidenav meer verwarring geeft dan overzicht. Bijvoorbeeld als er veel manieren om te navigeren zijn.\n- ...de componenten die weergegeven worden in de sidenav geen logisch verband met elkaar hebben en de gebruiker niet helpen met het geven van overzicht.\n\n### 1.3.3 Variaties\n\nEr is één variatie op de sidenav beschikbaar. In deze variatie worden de broertjes en zusjes van de actieve pagina niet getoond.\n\n![Screenshot van sidenav met broertjes en zusjes](././static/screenshot_sidenav_001.png "Screenshot sidenav 1")\n\n![Screenshot van sidenav zonder broertjes en zusjes](././static/screenshot_sidenav_002.png "Screenshot sidenav 2")\n\n### 1.3.4 Anatomie \x3c!-- wat is het doel van 1.3.4?--\x3e\n\nDescribe the atanomy of a component, for example:\n\n- ul\n- li\n- a\n- active li\n- sibling\n\n## 1.4 Design tokens\n\n### 1.4.1 Global design tokens \x3c!-- wat is het doel van 1.4.1?--\x3e\n\nDeze global design tokens worden gebruikt in dit component:\n\n- --utrecht-font-family-sans-serif\n- --utrecht-space-inline-2xs\n- --utrecht-space-inline-xs\n- --utrecht-space-inline-md\n- --utrecht-grey-80\n- --utrecht-link-color\n- --utrecht-link-hover-color\n\n### 1.4.2 Interactive states \x3c!-- wat is het doel van 1.4.2?--\x3e\n\n- Hover\n- Focus\n- Active\n\n## 1.5 Best practices\n\n- Hou de tekst van de links in de sidebar kort. Verkort desnoods de naam naar een gedeelte van de pagina titel.\n- Test altijd de sidenav. Zeker bij een langere hierarchie is het soms nodig om het eindproduct te zien. Mogelijk valt een gedeelte van de navigatie weg van de onderkant van het scherm.\n\n## 1.6 Referenties\n\n1.

The page maximizes the width of the content for large viewports, to keep the line length of texts readable and avoid large horizontal distances between related components.\n\nTypically the contents of the page component are:\n\n- Page Header component\n- Page Content component\n  - Main content\n  - Complimentary content\n- Page Footer component\n\n## API\n\n- CSS class name: `utrecht-page`\n- Web component: `<utrecht-page>`\n- Angular/React/Vue.js component: `UtrechtPage`\n\n## CSS implementation\n\n### Margin\n\nTo create some transparent space around the page, `margin-inline` CSS variables are provided. However, to automatically horizontally center the page `margin-inline: auto` needs to be used.\n\nAchieving both goals is made possible by implementing the `margin-inline` as `padding-inline` on a transparent container element. The only downside to this approach is that margin collapsing won't work anymore, but that doesn't seem like anyone would ever need for a component that realistically is only used once per document.\n\n### Padding\n\nPadding is not applied directly in the page component itself, but in the child components such as Page Header, Page Content and Page Footer.\n"},"../../components/pagination/README.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports="\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# Pagination navigation\n"},"../../components/pagination/design.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports="\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n\x3c!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 --\x3e\n\n## Design\n\n[Figma - Utrecht Design System - Pagination](https://www.figma.com/file/msb3CfQBefPoruqNQ968Zh/Utrecht-Design-System?node-id=302%3A6325)\n"},"../../components/paragraph/README.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports="\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# Paragraph\n\n## Line height van 1.5 als standaard\n\nDe standaard 1.5 line height is vanwege de dubbele underline die we op het link component bij een hover hebben staan.

Add those to your development checklist. Warning: not every example widget implementation works great with screen readers, so test this yourself before deciding to use it as reference.\n- When estimating Story Points for a component, make sure you have a clear understanding of the accessibility requirements. This helps you to avoid overcommitting to work in a sprint and feel forced to rush the accessibility aspects.\n\nDuring development:\n\n- Be mindful of accessibility warnings in Storybook.\n- Stay in communication with designers to evolve the design when needed, do not let the initial design stand in the way of making an accessible product.\n- Install browser plugins to test accessibility when integrating components in your project.\n\nDuring testing:\n\n- Test using just a keyboard, and no mouse or touch.\n- Test in Windows with [High Contrast Mode](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-high-contrast-mode-on-or-off-in-windows-909e9d89-a0f9-a3a9-b993-7a6dcee85025). The algorithm to display your website in highly contrasting colors isn't without flaws: sometimes important details such as icons and the focus outline are no longer perceivable.\n- Test using a screen reader, consider using captions instead of the voice synthesizer.\n- Test using visual perception simulation tools for blurry vision and color blindness.\n\nWhen your project is in beta:\n\n- Consider testing your product with users with diverse abilities.\n\nFor release candidates:\n\n- Request an accessibility audit.\n- Report back any issues related to design system components and patterns to the backlog.\n- Fix reported bugs before going to production.\n\nFor production:\n\n- Offer a way to report accessibility issues.\n"},"../../documentation/nl-design-system/contributing-css.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports='\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# Contribution Guidelines for CSS\n\n## Configure your code editor to catch mistakes early\n\nInstall plugins for color coding of CSS and SCSS:\n\n- Sublime: [`SCSS`](https://github.com/MarioRicalde/SCSS.tmbundle)\n\n## Use Stylelint to maintain consistency and high quality\n\nStylelint can run in your code editor while working on CSS code, by installing an extension:\n\n- VS Code: [stylelint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint)\n- Sublime: [`SublimeLinter-stylelint`](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-stylelint)\n\nStylelint will run as Git pre-commit hook, so it will warn you if you commit code that needs changes still.

This means using `-left` and `-right` is best avoided in many cases, because the values would need to be inversed for the other text direction.\n\nCSS now offers alternatives that work for all text directions, and are inversed automatically depending on the context. The new method also makes `-top` and `-bottom` obsolete, because the new CSS properties are also agnostic for the [vertical text direction in East Asian scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_and_vertical_writing_in_East_Asian_scripts).\n\nFor pages with Latin scripts you should use the following alternatives:\n\n- `margin` shorthand should not be used\n- `margin-top` becomes `margin-block-start`\n- `margin-right` becomes `margin-inline-end`\n- `margin-bottom` becomes `margin-block-end`\n- `margin-left` becomes `margin-inline-start`\n- `padding` shorthand should not be used\n- `padding-top` becomes `padding-block-start`\n- `padding-right` becomes `padding-inline-end`\n- `padding-bottom` becomes `padding-block-end`\n- `padding-left` becomes `padding-inline-start`\n\nDo not use the the following new shorthands yet, since they don\'t have great browser support at the moment:\n\n- `margin-block` ([Can I use …?](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_margin-block))\n- `margin-inline` ([Can I use …?](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_margin-inline))\n- `padding-block` ([Can I use …?](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_padding-block))\n- `padding-inline` ([Can I use …?](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_padding-inline))\n\nThe following article may be of interest, if you want to know more about these new CSS properties:\n\n- [Digging Into CSS Logical Properties, by Ahmad Shadeed](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-logical-properties/)\n\n## Use BEM class names to structure your component\n\nDon\'t use BEM syntax for CSS variables, however:\n\n```css\n.example-card__heading {\n  color: var(--example-card__heading-color);\n}\n```\n\nOnly use dashes to separate segments of the CSS variable name:\n\n```css\n.example-card__heading {\n  color: var(--example-card-heading-color);\n}\n```\n\n- [BEM — Block Element Modifier](http://getbem.com)\n\n## Separately define vanilla HTML element selectors\n\nIf you need to style HTML elements without class names, define those selectors in a separate file. For example:\n\n`bem.css`\n\n```css\n.nl-link {\n  color: var(--nl-link-color);\n}\n\n.nl-link--focus {\n  color: var(--nl-link-focus-color);\n}\n```\n\n`html.scss`:\n\n```scss\n@import "./bem";\n\na {\n  @extend .nl-link;\n}\n\na:focus {\n  @extend .nl-link--focus;\n}\n```\n\nHaving a file with only BEM class name selectors will help making your layout reusable in other components and other component libraries.\n\n## Separately define the CSS variable values from the layout\n\nDo not include the custom properties that define your theme in the same file that defines the layout of a component:\n\n`components/link.css`:\n\n```css\n.nl-link {\n  color: var(--nl-link-color);\n}\n```\n\n`theme/link.css`:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --nl-link-color: cornflowerblue;\n}\n```\n\nThis way, others that don\'t use the same theme as you, can only include the `component.css` and configure their own theme.\n\n## Use a prefix for your project in class names and CSS variables\n\nStart all the names in your code with the same prefix that identifies your project. When others want to reuse your code, they will not have any issues with their and your code using identical names -- they will never clash because of the prefix.\n\nPrefixes make names bit longer, but give you a great advantage for exchanging code between projects and collaborating with other teams.\n\nFor example, a `xyz` prefix for class names:\n\n```css\n.xyz-link {\n  color: blue;\n}\n```\n\nFor example, a `xyz` prefix for CSS variables:\n\n```css\na:link {\n  color: var(--xyz-link-color);\n}\n```\n\nPrefixes can be long or short, but you should be careful to pick something that is likely to be unique amongst the project which you want to collaborate.\n\n## Use prefixed CSS variables from other projects, share and enjoy the work of others\n\nWhen another project already has component or a CSS variable that does exactly what you need, you don\'t have to create one yourself with your own prefix. You can simply reuse the CSS variable with the prefix from the original author. **It is okay to have many prefixes in one file!**\n\n```css\n.example-component {\n  font-family: var(--example-component-font-family, var(--nl-document-font-family));\n}\n```\n\n## Use CSS variables for themable properties\n\nTo make your component reusable for many different themes and a wide variety of visual designs, you can use CSS variables to separate your choice for the visual design from the CSS code for the component.\n\nCSS properties that have different values for different themes should be configured with a CSS variable instead of a hardcoded value. Typical properties are related to color and typography, and often spacing too.\n\nCSS properties that don\'t vary between themes, don\'t need a CSS variable. Variables that typically have a hardcoded value include `display`, `position`, et cetera.\n\nYour initial version of a component does not need to provide a CSS variable for every imaginable property, it is recommended to start out with fewer properties and add new CSS variables on request.\n\n```css\n.example-icon {\n  display: inline-block;\n}\n\n.example-icon,\n.example-icon--medium {\n  height: var(--example-icon-medium-height);\n  width: var(--example-icon-medium-width);\n}\n```\n\n## Name things after their purpose, not after the visual design\n\nDo not use the visual design in the naming of class names:\n\n```css\n.example-badge--maroon {\n  color: maroon;\n}\n```\n\nName the class name after the purpose instead:\n\n```css\n.example-badge--danger {\n  color: maroon;\n}\n```\n\n## Don\'t affect the layout outside your component: margins are opt-in\n\nAnother aspect of keeping your component CSS side-effect free is by not specifying `margin` by default.\n\n```css\n.example-paragraph {\n  font-size: var(--example-paragraph-font-size);\n}\n\n.example-paragraph--distanced {\n  margin-block-start: var(--example-paragraph-margin-block-start);\n}\n```\n\n## Include fallback values for CSS variables so making a theme is less time consuming\n\nIf you allow customization for a property with CSS variables, it can be convenient to have a fallback value so you don\'t have to specify _every_ custom property to make the theme work.\n\nFor example, for colors you can use `inherit` to keep the color unchanged from the parent element when the CSS variable is undefined:\n\n```css\n.example-heading {\n  color: var(--example-heading-color, inherit);\n}\n```\n\nIncluding fallback values will make it easier to create a theme for your components, because others need to specify much fewer properties to make the initial version work well.\n\n## Use only relative font sizes\n\nDo not use `px` font sizes:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  font-size: 10px;\n}\n\np {\n  font-size: 1.6rem;\n}\n```\n\nUse a relative font size instead.\n\n```css\n:root {\n  font-size: 62.5%;\n}\n\np {\n  font-size: 1.6rem;\n}\n```\n\nRelative font sizes don\'t offer the guarantuee the website looks the same on every browser, and that is okay. Relative font sizes offer the freedom to users to choose a larger default font-size when the 16px default size is too small to read, without affecting other parts of the layout and image sizes -- which would cause even less text content to fit on the screen.\n\nPage zoom is very convenient in many cases, but it is not the best solution for users that only want larger text.\n\n## Avoid nesting BEM class name selectors\n\nFor example:\n\n```html\n<ul class="example-nav">\n  <li class="example-nav__item example-nav__item--current">\n    <a class="example-nav__link" href="/">Home</a>\n  </li>\n  <li class="example-nav__item">\n    <a class="example-nav__link" href="/contact">Home</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nThe nesting in this example can be avoided:\n\n```css\n.example-nav__item--current .example-nav__link {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n```\n\nUpdate the template and include the `current` modifier for both elements:\n\n```html\n<li class="example-nav__item example-nav__item--current">\n  <a class="example-nav__link example-nav__link--current" href="/">Home</a>\n</li>\n```\n\nWith the modfier available for both elements, the nesting is no longer necessary.\n\n```css\n.example-nav__link--current {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n```\n\n## Include BEM modifier class names for pseudo-classes, even if you don\'t use them yourself\n\nInclude class names even for states for which CSS pseudo-classes are available, such as `focus` and `hover`:\n\n```css\n.example-link--hover {\n  text-decoration: underline;\n}\n\n.example-link--focus {\n  background-color: silver;\n}\n\n.example-link--visited {\n  color: purple;\n}\n```\n\nThese classes can be used for automated visual regression tests and automated accessibility tests. Including examples with these class names in Storybook will help keep track of every variant.\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li><a href="#" class="example-link">Example</a></li>\n  <li><a href="#" class="example-link example-link--hover">Example for :hover</a></li>\n  <li><a href="#" class="example-link example-link--focus">Example for :focus</a></li>\n  <li><a href="#" class="example-link example-link--visited">Example for :visited</a></li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n## Avoid short-hand properties that unintentionally override properties\n\n```css\n.example-card {\n  background: url("image.jpg");\n}\n```\n\nIn this example you can use `background-image` instead of `background`, and avoid resetting properties that might be defined elsewhere, such as `background-repeat` or `background-color`.\n\nThe same goes for `margin` in the following example:\n\n```css\nul {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis example code is only used to reset the browsers\' built-in stylesheet for vertical margin. You can make the reset stylesheet more specific like this, with the same effect:\n\n```css\nul {\n  margin-block-start: 0;\n  margin-block-end: 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Round values to a reasonable significance\n\nDesign tools that export CSS sometimes include calculated subpixel values with a degree of detail that isn\'t visible on most screens and browsers, and wasn\'t necessarily intended by the designer.\n\n```css\n.example-paragraph {\n  font-size: 16.143px;\n}\n```\n\nRound the values to whole pixels:\n\n```css\n.example-paragraph {\n  font-size: 16px;\n}\n```\n\n## Include the open source license in every file\n\nInclude the [SPDX license code](https://spdx.org/licenses/) for the open source license in a code comment at the start of the file:\n\n```css\n/**\n * @license EUPL-1.2\n * Copyright (c) 2021 NL Design System Community\n */\n```\n\nMany open source license allow copying and modifying their code, but require the copyright notice to be included in all derived works. If you copy over open source code from a project with a EUPL-1.2 compatible license, such as the MIT license, be careful to copy over the copyright notice too.\n\nFor example, if you would copy over CSS from the [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com), the code comment could look like this:\n\n```css\n/**\n * @license EUPL-1.2\n * Copyright (c) 2021 NL Design System Community\n * Copyright (c) 2011-2021 The Bootstrap Authors\n * Copyright (c) 2011-2021 Twitter, Inc.\n */\n```\n'},"../../documentation/nl-design-system/contributing-design-token.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports='\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# Contribution Guidelines for Design Tokens\n\n## Naming order\n\n1.

For packages that are not open source, you can use the official alternative format: `"license": "SEE LICENSE IN proprietary.txt"`.\n- Include `"private": true` as well if you don\'t mean to (re)distribute assets in this directory, such as licensed font files.\n- USE `"private": false` for packages that contain design tokens for your proprietary visual design, to empower vendors that build products for your organization by allowing them to build upon your design system infrastructure.\n\nTo ensure you don\'t forget any of the above steps, it can be helpful to include a `proprietary/.npmpackagejsonlintrc.json` file with specific rules that would trigger a warning when running [`npm-package-json-lint`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-package-json-lint) in your test automation scripts:\n\n```json\n{\n  "rules": {\n    "valid-values-license": ["error", ["SEE LICENSE IN proprietary.txt"]],\n    "valid-values-private": ["error", [true]]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo make your audience aware not all contents of your Git repository are open source, it will help to include a warning in your `README.md` file, so people visiting your GitHub page can easily find out about it.\n\n## Install your project using `npm ci` instead of `npm install`\n\nNew dependencies and new versions must be tested for compatibility and vetted for security issues, before you and your team start using them. If you haven\'t already perfectly configured your dependencies to never use version ranges (`~1.0.0` or `^1.0.0`), it will help to use `npm ci` instead of `npm install`.\n\nThe `npm ci` command will install the original version that was used when the code was initially developed, and not automatically update to newer versions that might or might not be compatible. This also means you don\'t automatically benefit from security patches, therefore make sure to combine this method with tools like Dependabot to stay up to date.\n\nUsing `npm ci` in your team can also help prevent situations where a certain commit works for one person on their machine, but not for another.\n\nIf you are using Yarn instead of npm, you can use the equivalent command `yarn --frozen-lockfile`.\n\n## Always install exact versions of dependencies\n\nWhen you add a new dependency you will immediately check on your local machine to see if it works as intended, after that you commit changes to the dependencies and share your successful result with your team or with "_future you_". Not all 3rd-party packages you depend on will always strictly follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org), and the result is that it is more difficult in the future to install the exact same versions you have been working with.\n\nWhile it is easy enough to revert back to the original versions defined in `package-lock.json`, it is much more difficult (if not downright impossible) if your project starts relying on features introduced in more recent versions that are automatically provided by using `npm install` to install the latest possible version that matches the `~x.y.z` or `^x.y.z` version range.\n\nYou can aim to achieve "reproducible builds" using fixed versions in your `package.json`. To do so, you must install all packages using `npm --save --save-exact` or `npm --save-dev --save-exact`, but including this argument every time is easy to forget. Configure this behavior as default by including the following setting in the `.npmrc` file for your repository:\n\n```text\n# Do not use a version range prefix, to depend on exact version\nsave-exact=true\nsave-prefix=\n\n```\n\n## Update your `package.json` dependencies using `npm` only\n\nTo add dependencies to your project, use `npm --save` or `npm --save-dev` in the terminal instead of editing the file using your code editor. Doing so will avoid achieve a couple of things:\n\n- Maintain alphabetical order perfectly, and you avoid later commits that "fix" your manual change.\n- Automatically respect the `save-prefix` settings from your projects `.npmrc` file.\n- Automatically update the `package-lock.json` file, without updating any unrelated dependencies in the process.\n- Indentation remains standardized: no risk for accidentaly using tabs or 4 spaces instead of 2 spaces, which another later commit would then need to fix.\n\n## Don\'t use code formatting tools for `package.json`\n\nUsing tools to format code in `package.json` will reduce the ability of automated tools to create clean commits, when they affect the maximum line length or using anything else than the 2 space default indentation. When tools like Dependabot are not able to create clean commits and affect only the lines of code relevant to the change, they will increase the amount of time you need to spend on resolving merge conflicts. There are so many things you can better spend your time on!\n\nConfigure tools like Prettier to avoid interfering with the formatting of dependency files:\n\n`.prettierignore`:\n\n```text\n# Ignore generated files\npackage.json      # Node.js ecosystem\npackage-lock.json # Node.js ecosystem\nyarn.lock         # Node.js ecosystem\ncomposer.json     # PHP ecosystem\n```\n\n## Keep your dependencies up to date with automated pull requests\n\nTools like [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com) and [Snyk](http://snyk.io) can help you to stay up to date with the latest versions of dependencies, by automatically opening a pull request with a patch to update to the latest version.\n\nA significant advantage is that every PR will immediately show the effect on your automated tests, and indicate which updates may be safe to install. GitHub Actions can show a red X-mark (❌) for changes that would cause your project to break, and require additional work to migrate your code and work with the new version.\n\nRelying on these automated PRs can help find a balance between having exact and vetted dependencies, while at the same time staying up to date without too much hassle.\n'},"../../documentation/nl-design-system/contributing-storybook.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports='\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# Contribution Guidelines for Storybook\n\n## Story names should be clear in stand-alone context\n\nStory names should accurately describe the situation in the story. Story names are not only displayed in the Storybook sidebar: they also function as the caption for a screenshot in visual regression tests. A clear description helps to quickly decide if a visual change is the desired result or a regression bug.\n\nIf it helps, you can think of it this way: when the story canvas is an HTML `img` element, the story name would be the `alt` attribute.\n\n## Create a story for each state, don\'t rely on controls\n\nFor example, for the hyperlink component, you should include stories for the following states:\n\n- normal\n- hover\n- focus\n- visited\n\nHaving separate stories helps test automation detect issues with any state, without writing code to trigger the interaction. Accessibility tests can recognize color contrast issues in every state, and easily detect an issue in the disabled state of a button. Visual regression tests can compare screenshots in every state, and easily detect a regression bug in for example the focus state.\n\n## Write documentation in Markdown and lower the barrier for contributing\n\nIn Storybook it is common to type documentation in `.mdx` files that combine text and code.

Het doel van deze afspraken is om de producten consistent en de gebruikerservaring zo prettig mogelijk te maken. Een Design System ‘leeft’: dankzij nieuwe inzichten en feedback van gebruikers worden de afspraken continu verbeterd.\n\n## Hoe werkt een Design System\n\nDe afspraken in het Design System worden gemaakt aan de hand van bewezen oplossingen. Ze vormen een solide basis voor de ontwerpers en ontwikkelaars: doordat zij het wiel niet steeds opnieuw hoeven uit te vinden, kunnen ze snel en effectief nieuwe digitale producten bouwen. Als je als organisatie met een Design System werkt, bouw je voort op elkaars ervaringen en houd je meer tijd over voor unieke, eenmalige uitdagingen. Wel is er een betrokken, actieve community nodig om het Design System actueel en praktisch toepasbaar te houden.\n\n## Waarom een Utrecht Design System\n\nIn een Design System staan principes, handvatten, elementen, patronen en richtlijnen beschreven. Allemaal basisonderdelen waarover je goed afspraken kunt maken. Juist overheidsorganisaties hebben baat bij één duidelijke set herbruikbare basisonderdelen. Vooral voor levensgebeurtenissen, waarbij vaak contact nodig is met meerdere instanties en organisaties.\n\nDankzij het Utrecht Design System kan de hele gemeente samenwerken aan een begrijpelijke, gebruiksvriendelijke én toegankelijke online dienstverlening. Een dienstverlening die logisch en samenhangend is, maar niet per se uniform, want binnen de afspraken blijft er ruimte voor de eigen identiteit van overheidsorganisaties.\n\nOmdat het Utrecht Design System gekoppeld is aan het NL Design System, blijven we aangesloten aan landelijke ontwikkelingen.\n\n## Voor (en door) iedereen\n\nHet is belangrijk dat iedereen de online dienstverlening van de overheid kan gebruiken, ongeacht wie je bent en wat je situatie is. Dit heet inclusie: iedereen moet kunnen meedoen. Daarom testen we de afspraken in het Design System met een heel diverse gebruikersgroep, waaronder mensen met beperkingen. Zo nemen de kwaliteit, bruikbaarheid en toegankelijkheid toe en kunnen we iedereen in Nederland met onze digitale producten steeds beter van dienst zijn.\n\n## Doe je voordeel met de documentatie\n\nHet lijkt ons nuttig als andere overheidsorganisaties gebruik kunnen maken van de documentatie en daarmee hun design systems beter maken voor de inwoners van Nederland. Daarom is alle documentatie (richtlijnen, inzichten van onderzoek, design beslissingen, etc.) die wij schrijven in ons Design System beschikbaar onder de [CC0 1.0 Universeel licentie](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.nl), en geven daarmee iedereen toestemming deze documentatie te delen en te hergebruiken.\n"},"../../documentation/website/gebruikersonderzoek/research.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports="---\ntitle: Gebruikersonderzoek\nhide_title: true\nhide_table_of_contents: true\nsidebar_label: Overzicht\nsidebar_position: 1\npagination_label: Overzicht\ndescription: Gebruikersonderzoek Overzicht\nkeywords:\n  - index\n  - overzicht\n  - gebruikersonderzoek\n---\n\n\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# Gebruikersonderzoek\n\nGebruiksvriendelijk en toegankelijke producten en diensten voor alle inwoners van de Gemeente Utrecht.\n\n## Overzicht\n\nHieronder staat een overzicht van de gebruikersonderzoeken die we gedaan hebben.

Deze respondenten kregen een case voorgelezen waarna ze in de test-omgeving moesten proberen hun melding te doen.\nVan de respondenten waren er drie blind of slechtziend en drie ex-laaggeletterd.\n\n## Belangrijkste inzichten\n\nDe belangrijkste inzichten zijn:\n\n### Blinden en slechtzienden lopen vast in het proces\n\nHet is voor de blinden niet duidelijk dat er een verplicht invulveld zit in de kaart om het adres in te vullen. Ze vullen het niet in en gaan door in het formulier. Dit, gecombineerd met een onduidelijke foutmelding zorgt er voor dat ze vast komen te zitten en uit het proces vallen.\n\nBij de overige respondenten is er geen verwarring in het doorlopen van de testomgeving. De volgorde van stappen worden begrepen en zonder moeite doorlopen.\n\n### Notificaties geven vertrouwen\n\nDe notificatie e-mails worden als fijn ervaren. Het is belangrijk om de bevestiging te krijgen dat jouw melding serieus genomen wordt en opgepakt wordt. Ook is het belangrijk dat ze te weten krijgen wanneer het opgelost is. Daarnaast worden de smileys in de 3e mail aangeklikt. De e-mails worden wel als veel ervaren (3 is misschien 1 te veel), maar dit kan ook komen omdat er nu geen tijd tussen zit.\n\n### Toegankelijkheidsfouten zorgen voor ruis\n\n- Het zoomen in de kaart op de mobiel ging niet soepel op mobiel, dit kan ook komen doordat Teams tegelijkertijd werd gebruikt.\n- Wanneer je geen adres aanklikt wordt is er voor het systeem geen adres ingevuld.\n- Als iets niet correct is ingevuld op de eerste pagina is dit niet zichtbaar wanneer je aan de onderkant van de pagina zit.

Ze vullen het niet in en gaan door in het formulier. Dit, gecombineerd met een onduidelijke foutmelding zorgt er voor dat ze vast komen te zitten en uit het proces vallen.\n\nBij de overige respondenten is er geen verwarring in het doorlopen van de testomgeving. De volgorde van stappen worden begrepen en zonder moeite doorlopen.\n\nDit inzicht heeft geleid tot specifieke inzichten in het Button component. Deze zijn daar te vinden onder het Documentatie > Onderzoek.\n\n### 002 - Notificaties geven vertrouwen\n\nDe notificatie e-mails worden als fijn ervaren. Het is belangrijk om de bevestiging te krijgen dat jouw melding serieus genomen wordt en opgepakt wordt. Ook is het belangrijk dat ze te weten krijgen wanneer het opgelost is. Daarnaast worden de smileys in de 3e mail aangeklikt. De e-mails worden wel als veel ervaren (3 is misschien 1 te veel), maar dit kan ook komen omdat er nu geen tijd tussen zit.\n\n### 003 - Toegankelijkheidsfouten zorgen voor ruis\n\n- Het zoomen in de kaart op de mobiel ging niet soepel op mobiel, dit kan ook komen doordat Teams tegelijkertijd werd gebruikt.\n- Wanneer je geen adres aanklikt wordt is er voor het systeem geen adres ingevuld.\n- Als iets niet correct is ingevuld op de eerste pagina is dit niet zichtbaar wanneer je aan de onderkant van de pagina zit. Dit zorgt voor verwarring > waarom kan ik niet op volgende klikken\n\n### 004 - Interessant voor verder onderzoek\n\nEr waren een aantal geïnterviewden die aangaven dat ze op de kaart al gemelde meldingen willen zien. Dit hebben we niet kunnen testen want die functionaliteit is er nog niet. Het roept ook veel vragen op. Het zou tof zijn om dit verder te kunnen onderzoeken. Niemand begint hiermee, dit komt pas boven aan het einde van het onderzoek.\n\n### 005 - Adres invullen voor blinden en slechtzienden gaat niet goed\n\n- Blinden zien niet dat er een kaart is en krijgen geen audio-prompt dat er een kaart is. Als je dan niet precies weet waar je je melding wil doen, zit je vast.\n- De label die wordt voorgelezen bij het adresveld geeft geen duidelijke beschrijving van de actie die de melder moet doen, namelijk het invullen van het adres van de melding.\n- Het adresveld genereert een lege keuzelijst, deze lege lijst werkt verwarrend voor iemand die voorlees software gebruikt, deze leest "deze lijst is leeg".\n\n### 006 - Foutmelding als de kaart niet goed is ingevuld werkt niet goed\n\n- Doordat blinden en slechtziende niet goed met de kaart en het adres invoer veld overweg kunnen komt er een error. Er gebeurt niets als er een error is, de error wordt niet kenbaar gemaakt, een blinde is dan de weg kwijt en stopt met een melding doen.\n- De error is alleen visueel. De tekst van de error maakt ook niet duidelijk dat het een error is. Voor blinden/slechtzienden is dit gewoon een stukje tekst die vraagt een adres in te vullen, maar dat was nou juist het probleem.\n- Blinden en slecht zienden moeten kunnen horen wat ze moeten doen of wat er verkeerd gaat\n\n### 007 - Bevestiging na keuze\n\n- Punten op de kaart worden voorgelezen als nummer (lon/lat), dit voegt niets toe voor iemand die blind is.\n- Na het kiezen van een adres is het niet duidelijk dat dit adres gekozen is.\n\n## Resultaat\n\nHet formulier waarin de melder het adres moet invullen wordt aangepast door de makers zodat ook blinden en slechtzienden een melding kunnen doen.\n\n## Wat ook opmerkelijk was\n\nWe kregen van de blinden en slechtzienden de volgende tips waarin ziende mensen zich goed kunnen inleven in de wereld van blinden en slechtzienden:\n\n- Doe een melding zonder je muis te gebruiken\n- Gebruik voorleessoftware (Supernova, Jaws NVDA) en doe een melding met je ogen dicht\n- Gebruik de apple toegankelijkheids stand (Toegankelijkheid>voice over) en probeer met je ogen dicht een melding te doen.\n'},"../../documentation/website/huisstijl/typography.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports="---\ntitle: Typografie\nhide_title: true\nhide_table_of_contents: false\nsidebar_label: Typografie\nsidebar_position: 2\npagination_label: Typografie\ndescription: Het huisstijl font van de gemeente Utrecht en alternatieven\nkeywords:\n  - tekst\n  - typografie\n  - utrecht\n---\n\n\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# Typografie\n\n## Font family\n\nWe gebruiken de Lucida font family omdat het een font is dat goed leesbaar is op digitale applicaties.

Dat betekent: rekening houden met je lezer, een persoonlijke benadering kiezen en ervoor zorgen dat de taal begrijpelijk is. Zorg er daarom voor dat begrijpelijke taal in een vroeg stadium van de productontwikkeling gewaarborgd is.\n\nPublieke organisaties hebben contact met veel verschillende mensen. Hoe zorg je voor duidelijke taal? Hoe maak je jouw communicatieboodschap inclusief en dus begrijpelijk voor iedereen?\n\nTaal in het NL Design System bestaat uit meerdere niveaus. Op een hoog niveau geven we tips en sturing over duidelijk taalgebruik in het algemeen, op component-niveau bieden we daarnaast uitleg over best practices over ‘applicatieve tekst’.\n\n### Content soorten\n\n#### Informerende tekst\n\nLopende artikel tekst, tabellen tekst.\n\n#### Service-content\n\nBv. help bestanden, veelgestelde vragen, contactgegevens.\n\n#### ‘Applicatieve’ tekst\n\nBv. knoptekst, formulierlabels, feedbacktekst, contextuele helptekst.\n\n## Voor wie schrijven we\n\nTaal en toegankelijkheid gaan hand in hand. Als de tekst over een product niet of moeilijk begrepen wordt, dan is het product niet toegankelijk. Duidelijke taal zorgt er voor dat iedereen begrijpt wat je met je tekst wilt overbrengen.\n\nVeel mensen hebben baat bij duidelijke taal:\n\n### Mensen die laaggeletterd zijn\n\nMensen die laaggeletterd zijn hebben moeite met lezen, schrijven en/of rekenen. Verwar dit niet met de term analfabeten. Ze kunnen wel lezen en schrijven, maar beheersen niet het eindniveau vmbo of niveau mbo-2/3.\n\n### Mensen die Nederlands niet als moedertaal hebben\n\nHet kunnen mensen zijn die doof zijn en waarbij gebarentaal hun moedertaal is. Nederlandse Gebarentaal (NGT) heeft een andere grammatica en vocabulaire. Het zijn ook mensen met een migratieachtergrond en die een andere moedertaal hebben dan het Nederlands.\n\n### Mensen met autisme\n\nMensen met autisme hebben moeite met begrijpend lezen. Zij vatten woorden letterlijk op.\n\n### Mensen die dyslectisch zijn\n\nMensen die dyslectisch zijn hebben behoefte aan begrijpelijke taal, goede opmaak zoals koppen, voldoende wit tussen de regels, opsommingen.\n\nHoger opgeleiden hebben ook baat bij begrijpelijke taal. Zij lezen ook liever een tekst in B1 geschreven. Maar denk ook aan aan mensen die zorgen en stress hebben en zaken moeten regelen bij de overheid.\n\n#### Do\n\n- Schrijf korte, actieve zinnen met dagelijks taalgebruik\n- Gebruik alternatieven om tekst te ondersteunen zoals afbeeldingen, video en spraak\n- Tracht meerkeuze antwoorden in formulieren te gebruiken\n- Zorg voor rustige webpagina’s\n- Geef waar nodig positieve feedback, uitleg en hulp\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Vermijd jargon\n- Vermijd afkortingen\n- Vermijd kinderachtig taalgebruik\n- Vermijd abstracte figuren\n- Vermijd metaforen\n- Vermijd sarcasme en ironie\n- Vermijd open tekstvelden en voorkom dat een gebruiker veel moet typen in formulieren\n- Vermijd afleiding zoals banners of drukke achtergronden\n- Voorkom tijdsdruk\n\n### Screen readers\n\n#### Alternatieve tekst voor afbeeldingen\n\nAlternatieve of ‘alt-’tekst wordt gebruikt om te beschrijven wat op een informatieve afbeelding weergegeven wordt. Dit wordt alleen voor afbeeldingen gebruikt die daadwerkelijk informatie toevoegen en niet voor decoratieve afbeeldingen. Deze tekst wordt tevens weergegeven in gevallen dat afbeeldingen niet laden en geïndexeerd door zoekmachines.\n\nNaast een beschrijving over wat er op de afbeelding staat is het belangrijk in de alt-tekst je bedoeling met de afbeelding over te brengen, afhankelijk van de context.\n\nVragen om jezelf te stellen bij het maken van een alternatieve tekst:\n\n- Waarom staat de afbeelding hier?\n- Wat is het doel van de afbeelding?\n- Welke informatie wil ik met de afbeelding overbrengen?\n- Als ik geen afbeelding kon gebruiken, hoe zou ik deze informatie dan overbrengen?\n\n##### Voorbeeld zonsondergang met drone\n\n![Diep oranje zonsondergang met het silhouet van een drone.](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1489558546780-a69e0b3293e1?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1352&q=80)\n\n1. Diep oranje zonsondergang met het silhouet van een drone.\n2. De camera is ingesteld om de zonsondergang correct te belichten, waardoor de drone op de voorgrond een silhouet wordt.\n\n## Richtlijnen voor leesbaarheid\n\n### Duidelijke, klare taal\n\nMaak teksten duidelijk en begrijpelijk.\n\nEenvoudig geschreven tekst:\n\n- is makkelijk te scannen en te begrijpen\n- laat zich makkelijker vertalen (door bv. Google Translate of andere automatische vertaal-programmatuur)\n- helpt gebruikers die Nederlands niet als basistaal hebben geleerd\n- draagt bij aan een goede SEO score\n- helpt gebruikers die afhankelijk zijn van screenreaders\n- zorgt dat laaggeletterden tekst beter kunnen consumeren\n\n#### Do’s\n\n- Verkies makkelijke korte boven formele lange woorden.\n- Gebruik korte, eenvoudige zinnen. Probeer niet meer dan 15 woorden per zin te gebruiken, langere zinnen kunnen eventueel opgebroken worden in meerdere zinnen.\n- Maak gebruik van opsommingstekens waar dat mogelijk is.\n- Maak specialistische inhoud tevens begrijpelijk voor niet-experts. Dien je toch specialistische termen te gebruiken, tracht deze dan zo goed mogelijk uit te leggen d.m.v. van een definitie of link naar verdieping.\n- Test teksten in context met gebruikers.\n\n#### Don’ts\n\n- Vermijd complexe zinsbouw.\n- Vermijd vakjargon en ‘buzzwords’.\n- Vermijd het gebruik van metaforen.\n- Vermijd het gebruik van Latijnse tekst.\n\n### Woorden om te vermijden, en hun alternatieven\n\n## Taalregels en grammatica\n\n### Aanhalingstekens\n\nAltijd enkele aanhalingstekens gebruiken, ook al is het een uitspraak van een persoon.\n\n### Aanspreekvorm\n\nSpreek de bezoeker aan met ‘je’, ‘jij’ of ‘u’.\n\n### Afkortingen\n\n- Vermijd afkortingen zoveel mogelijk.\n- Schrijf afkortingen van bijvoorbeeld bedrijven of wetten de eerste keer voluit en vermeld tussen haakjes de afkorting.\n\n### Algemene afkortingen\n\n- Gebruik geen afkortingen van gewone woorden als ‘bijvoorbeeld’, ‘onder andere’, ‘namelijk’ en 'et cetera'.\n- Uitgangspunt is dat we namen van bedrijven voluit schrijven. Uitzonderingen zijn algemeen bekende en ingesleten letterwoorden: KLM, KPN, NS.\n- Schrijf afkortingen in hoofdletters zonder punten of spaties: VPRO, IOP, ICT, IT, tenzij de officiële afkorting anders is.\n- Ingeburgerde afkortingen schrijf je met kleine letters aan elkaar: btw, mkb, pc, tv, sms, hbo, cv, hiv, aids, cao, bnp, bbp.\n- Afleidingen van afkortingen krijgen een apostrof: mkb'er, tv’tje, sms’je.\n- Maakt de afkorting deel uit van een samenstelling, dan volgt na de afkorting een liggend streepje: tv-toestel, mkb-ondernemer. Samenstellingen zijn woorden die zijn opgebouwd uit twee of meer woorden die ook zelfstandig kunnen voorkomen.\n- Gebruik bestaande afkortingen van belastingen, wetten en regelingen. Afgekorte titels krijgen een kleine letter (met punt): drs., lic., mr., prof. en dr., maar BA, MA, PhD, MBA.\n- Voor internationaal erkende symbolen in handel, techniek en wetenschap gelden de internationaal vastgelegde conventies: kg, mm, kW, kWh, MW, MWh, GW, GWh, CO2, Hz, H2O, brt, °C en km2\n\n### Ampersand\n\nVoorkom het gebruik van een ampersand (&). Deze leggen visuele nadruk op de minst belangrijke informatie in een zin. Gebruik daarvoor in de plaats het woord ‘en’.\n\n### Benadrukken\n\nGa spaarzaam om met het benadrukken van woorden in de tekst:\n\n- Gebruik vet om enkele belangrijke woorden te benadrukken. Denk aan een waarschuwing.\n- Gebruik cursief om een enkel woord te benadrukken. Bij cursief verandert de toon waarop iets gezegd wordt of het woord heeft een speciale betekenis zodat de hele zin anders wordt. Spraaksoftware leest dit woord of woorden dan ook anders voor.\n- Onderstrepen mag je niet gebruiken omdat dit op een link lijkt.\n- Wees zuinig met uitroeptekens en gebruik er nooit meer dan één.\n\n### Data en tijdsaanduidingen\n\nWees zo actueel mogelijk en noem concrete data en jaartallen. Noem de datum inclusief het jaartal, eventueel inclusief de dag van de week. Gebruik geen tijdsaanduidingen zoals gisteren, binnenkort, dit najaar of jongstleden (jl.). Gisteren is onduidelijk in een webtekst zonder datum. Binnenkort is vaag. Zeg bijvoorbeeld ‘het najaar van 2012’.\n\n#### Bij data\n\n- Jaartallen voluit (2007).\n- Maanden voluit (mei).\n- Dagen in cijfers, zonder voorloopnul: 1 mei 2007.\n\n#### Bij tijdsaanduiding\n\n- Gebruik bij de weergave van tijdstippen de 24-uursindeling, waarbij uren en minuten door een punt gescheiden worden.\n- Uren in cijfers, tot 10 uur geen voorloopnullen.\n- Vermeld tijden zonder 00.\n- Minuten in cijfers.\n\nVoorbeeld: Bereikbaar van 9 tot 16.30 uur.\n\n### Drieledige samenstellingen\n\nDrieledige samenstellingen worden doorgaans aaneengeschreven.\n\nVoorbeeld: langetermijnplanning\n\n### Geldbedragen\n\n- Als je het cijfer in letters uitschrijft, dan schrijf je euro achter het bedrag ook uit. Voorbeeld: tien euro.\n- Gebruik je cijfers, gebruik dan ook het euroteken (€). Tussen het euroteken en het bedrag een spatie. Voorbeeld: € 10,- en € 10,75.\n- In tabellen het euroteken gebruiken (€).\n- Duizendtallen met een punt. Voorbeeld: € 1.300\n\nGebruik voor getallen in webteksten cijfers. Geldbedragen worden dus altijd met cijfers en eurotekens geschreven. Cijfers zijn makkelijker te scannen dan getallen die uit letters bestaan.\n\n### Getallen\n\nGebruik voor getallen in webteksten cijfers. Dus ‘8 weken’ in plaats van ‘acht weken’. Gebruik ook cijfers in het begin van een zin. ’12 jaar later ging hij …’\n\nCijfers zijn makkelijker te scannen dan getallen die uit letters bestaan.\n\n- Getallen in exacte en zakelijke mededelingen in cijfers. Voorbeelden: op 4 oktober, maximumsnelheid 100 km, tijd: 14.00 uur, 33% (echter: als je ‘procent’ uitschrijft, dan ook het cijfer uitschrijven), hoofdstuk 4.\n- Rangtelwoorden met de of ste – afhankelijk van de uitspraak – (ook overal e is correct). Voorbeelden: 7de, 7e, 38ste, 38e.\n- Getallen in breuken – alleen onder de twintig - in woorden en altijd los. Voorbeelden: een kwart, een achtste, vier en een half, half elf, tweeënhalf, drie kwart miljoen.\n- Geldbedragen in woorden aaneenschrijven. Na duizend volgt een spatie. Miljoen en miljard zijn aparte woorden. Bij geldbedragen van vier of meer cijfers een punt gebruiken om duizendtallen aan te geven. Voorbeelden: 430.000 of € 430.000.\n- Als in één zin of in één alinea meerdere getallen staan, die afwisselend in letters en in cijfers moeten worden uitgeschreven, kies je ervoor om alle getallen in cijfers te vermelden. Voorbeeld: De 79 reacties leiden tot 3 verschillende bijeenkomsten. (3 is dus niet drie).\n\n### Hoofdlettergebruik\n\nBegin iedere koptekst en (paragraaf) zin met een hoofdletter.\n\nGebruik hoofdletters voor landen, persoonsnamen, merk- en productnamen.\n\nVermijd het zetten van hele woorden in hoofdletters (all-caps). De leesbaarheid wordt hiermee verminderd doordat woorden een uniforme rechthoekige vorm krijgen. Lezers kunnen woorden hierdoor niet aan hun vorm herkennen of onderscheiden. Bovendien kan het als schreeuwerig ervaren worden.\n\n### Internet en e-mail\n\n- Gebruik bij het vermelden van internet- en e-mailadressen in een tekst kleine letters. Voorbeeld: info@pgb.nl.\n- Gebruik geen toevoeging ‘‘http://‘ of ‘https://’\n\n### Koppeltekens\n\nVermijd het gebruik van koppeltekens.\n\nVoorbeeld: Aanmelden en afmelden (niet aan- en afmelden)\n\n### Namen van wetten\n\n- Bij namen van wetten, wetsvoorstellen volgen we de spelling en afkorting van de overheid (bij wetten wordt de citeertitel genoemd in de slotbepalingen).\n- Bij afgekorte namen van besluiten of overheidsplannen volgen we ook de officiële schrijfwijze van de overheid.\n\n### Opsommingen\n\nGebruik bij een opsomming opsommingstekens. De onderdelen van de opsomming hebben soms:\n\n- een hoofdletter en een punt;\n- kleine letters en wel of niet een puntkomma.\n\nAls de opsomming uit delen van zinnen bestaat, begint elke deel met een kleine letter en eindigt met puntkomma. Het laatste deel van de opsomming krijgt een punt. Als de opsomming uit hele zinnen bestaat, begint elk deel met een hoofdletter en eindigt de opsomming met een punt of vraagteken.\n\n#### Voorbeelden\n\nOp school heb ik geleerd:\n\n- boom\n- roos\n- vuur\n\nOp school heb ik geleerd dat:\n\n- de boom groot is;\n- de roos doorns heeft;\n- het vuur warm is.\n\nOp school heb ik het volgende geleerd:\n\n- De boom is groot.\n- De roos heeft doorns.\n- Het vuur is warm.\n\n### Percentages\n\nSchrijf ‘procent’ voluit, behalve in tabellen.\n\n### Rekeningnummers\n\nNoteer IBAN-nummers met spaties om de kans op verschrijvingen bij het overnemen ervan te verkleinen.\n\nNL99 [BANK] 0123 4567 89\n\nDus:\n\n- landcode en controlegetal (dat getal verschilt per rekeningnummer)\n- banklettercode\n- tiencijferig rekeningnummer in 4-4-2-combinatie\n\n### Telefoon- en faxnummers\n\nBij telefoonnummers schrijf je eerst het kengetal (drie of vier cijfers) aan elkaar. Daarna spatieer je de andere cijfers per twee van achteraf. Nationale telefoonnummers, mobiele nummers en 0900-nummers voorzie je van een koppelstreepje.\n\nBij een kengetal van drie cijfers: 045 - 220 21 21\n\nBij een kengetal van vier cijfers: 0165 - 32 06 08\n\nBij mobiele nummers: 06 - 52 70 28 92\n\nBij 0900 nummers: 0900 - 0001 (€ 0,10/minuut)\n\n### Tekst onderlijning\n\nVermijd het onderlijnen van tekst. Reserveer tekst onderlijning voor links.\n\n## Content ontwerp\n\nWebteksten beginnen met de essentie van de boodschap, de ‘conclusie’, met hierna de uitleg en achtergronden, de omgekeerde piramide. Bovenin staat de belangrijkste boodschap, onderin de minst belangrijke informatie. Het is essentieel dat de lezer aan de titel en het begin van de inleiding kan zien waarover de pagina gaat. Zorg voor call-to-actions zoals een link naar een download, contactinformatie of een andere website met meer informatie. Eindtekst kan verwijzing naar andere pagina of document zijn.\n\n### Paginatitel (SEO)\n\nDit is de titel die je in Google ziet. Paginatitel moet uniek en kort en krachtig zijn.\n\n- Is het onderwerp van de pagina, aangevuld met domeinnaam of organisatienaam\n- Maximaal 70 tekens inclusief spaties\n\n### Titel van de pagina: H1\n\nDit is de titel die je ziet op de pagina zelf\n\n- Gebruik de woorden van je doelgroep\n- Wees helder en informatief\n- Titel geeft samenvatting van de pagina\n- Gebruik een feit, vraag of call-to-action\n- Gebruik geen beeldspraak of uitdrukkingen\n- Paginatitel moet het focus keyword bevatten (SEO)\n- Maximaal 70 tekens inclusief spaties (SEO)\n\n### Koppen boven alinea’s\n\nWerk met tussenkoppen: zorg dat informatie herkenbaar is geordend.\n\n- Kop maakt duidelijk waar de alinea over gaat\n- Kop is eenduidig, concreet en kort (een paar woorden)\n- Kies een stijl: vragen, feiten of werkwoorden. Houd dezelfde stijl aan\n- Gebruik woorden van je doelgroep\n- Gebruik geen beeldspraak of uitdrukkingen\n- Gebruik de markeringen in je CMS (Kop 2, kop 3 of H2, H3 en geen vet, cursief of onderstreept.\n- Sla geen niveaus over (dus van H2 naar H4 of beginnen met H3)\n- Koppen maken samen de inhoudsopgave\n- Koppen maken de tekst voorspelbaar: je weet wat je gaat lezen\n- Naast de paginatitel moet minimaal 1 kop het focus keyword bevatten (SEO)\n\n### Alinea’s\n\n- 1e alinea bevat de belangrijkste informatie van de pagina.\n- Zet belangrijkste informatie aan begin van de alinea.\n- Maak korte, heldere alinea's. Alinea’s bestaan uit 2 tot 10 zinnen.\n- Gebruik witruimte tussen alinea's (geen shift+enter, maar enter)\n- Het aantal woorden per zin: maximaal 15, liever minder.\n- Schrijf afwisselend enkelvoudige zinnen (zonder komma’s, maximaal 15 woorden) en meervoudige zinnen (dus korte en iets langere zinnen).\n- Focus keyword moet een aantal keer voorkomen in de tekst: zo’n 2%. Bij een tekst van 300 woorden is dit 3 tot 6 keer. Het focus keyword moet in ieder geval in de intro voorkomen (SEO).\n- Gebruik signaalwoorden om paragrafen ‘aan elkaar te knopen’. Pas op dat de gebruikte woorden niet te ambtelijk zijn.\n\n### Gebruik opsommingen\n\nEen tekst wordt beter scanbaar door opsommingen te gebruiken.\n\n- Opsommingen maak je met de editor van het CMS\n- Meegekopieerde opsommingen vanuit Word verwijderen\n- Niet zelf witregels tussen opsommingen zetten\n- Niet zelf nummers typen of streepjes toevoegen\n\n### Links en linkteksten\n\n- Bied alleen relevante links aan\n- Maak niet te korte (1 kort woord) of te lange links (bijvoorbeeld over 2 regels)\n- Maak geen links in de intro van het bericht of pagina\n- Gebruik relevante inhoudswoorden en laat zien waarnaar ze verwijzen.\n  - Niet: klik hier\n  - Gebruik de url van de externe website als link. (Meer informatie vind je op www.rijksoverheid.nl)\n  - Vermeld bij een pdf achter de link dat het om een pdf-bestand gaat en hoeveel kB of MB deze is, afgerond op hele getallen. Bijvoorbeeld: Download de routebeschrijving (pdf, 50 kB)\n- Bij een link naar een e-mailadres moet het e-mailadres zichtbaar zijn als link: info@rijksoverheid.nl\n- Verwijs niet naar vormen, kleuren of plekken op desktopweergave. Bijvoorbeeld ‘In de rechterkolom vind je een overzicht van relevante documenten’. In de mobiele weergave heb je bijvoorbeeld geen rechterkolom.\n- Links openen in hetzelfde venster/tabblad. Dit geldt ook voor links naar externe websites.\n\n### Tekst uitlijning\n\nVerkies links uitgelijnde tekst boven gecentreerde en uitgevulde (justified) tekst.\n\nLinks uitgelijnde tekst is het comfortabelst om te lezen.\n\n## Referenties\n\nAlgemene referenties omtrent taal en content in design systems.\n\n- [Taaladvies](https://taaladvies.net/)\n- [Content in design systems](https://informaat.nl/nl/whitepapers/content-in-design-systems/)\n- [Direct Duidelijk schrijftips](https://directduidelijk.nl/schrijftips/tips)\n- [Direct Duidelijk checklist voor teksten](https://directduidelijk.nl/tips/checklist-voor-teksten)\n- [Direct Duidelijk koffer](https://directduidelijk.nl/tips/direct-duidelijk-koffer)\n- [Handboek webcontent](https://books.theinternetacademy.nl/handboek-webcontent/)\n- [Content Design London readability guidelines](https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/)\n- [Ontwerpen voor laaggeletterden (pdf)](https://inclusie.gebruikercentraal.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2019/05/Poster-Laaggeletterden.pdf)\n- [CommunicatieRijk Taalniveau B1](https://www.communicatierijk.nl/vakkennis/rijkswebsites/aanbevolen-richtlijnen/taalniveau-b1)\n- [Alternatieven voor ouderwetse en formele woorden](https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/ouderwets-taalgebruik)\n- [Direct Duidelijk Tour artikelen](https://directduidelijk.gebruikercentraal.nl/artikelen/)\n- [WCAG 2.1 Understanding Guideline 3.1: Readable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/readable)\n- [Is het b1?/](https://www.ishetb1.nl/)\n- [Zoek eenvoudige woorden](https://www.zoekeenvoudigewoorden.nl/)\n- [Direct Duidelijk taalhulplijn/](https://directduidelijkhulp.nl/taalhulplijn/index.aspx)\n- [ABC belangenbehartiging van en voor laaggeletterden](https://st-abc.nl/)\n- [Begrijpelijke en toepasbare voorlichtingsmaterialen & beeldverhalen](https://www.pharos.nl/thema/eenvoudig-voorlichtingsmateriaal-en-beeldverhalen/)\n- [Online checklist Toegankelijke informatie](https://www.pharos.nl/kennisbank/checklist-toegankelijke-informatie/)\n- [Writing for Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/writing/)\n\n## Geschiedenis\n\n### 0.5 (18-01-2021)\n\n- Richtlijnen m.b.t. taal en toegankelijkheid en ontwerpen voor laaggeletterden gewijzigd (Saskia Schrijver)\n- Richtlijnen voor alternatieve tekst voor afbeeldingen gewijzigd en voorzien van voorbeeld (Ronny Hendriks)\n\n### 0.4 (12-01-2021)\n\n- Placeholder categorieën richtlijnen toegevoegd (via Mark Westbeek)\n\n### 0.3 (06-01-2021)\n\n- Referentie Handboek webcontent toegevoegd (Wiep Hamstra)\n\n### 0.2 (29-12-2020)\n\n- Sectie Content ontwerp toegevoegd (Saskia Schrijver)\n- Sectie Taalregels en grammatica uitgebreid (Saskia Schrijver)\n- Diverse wijzigingen en verbeteringen (Saskia Schrijver)\n\n### 0.1 (25-11-2020)\n\n- Eerste publieke versie\n"},"../component-library-css/README.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports='\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# CSS Components\n\nCSS components are developed using BEM class names and the stylesheets can be included in your page side-effect free. Apply the class names to your elements to make them stylable using design tokens.\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save-dev --save-exact @utrecht/component-library-css\n\n```\n\nTheoretically you can include the components in your HTML page like so, but this is not the typical use case of this library:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang="en">\n  <head>\n    <title>Example page</title>\n    <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@utrecht/component-library-css/dist/bem.css" />\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1 class="utrecht-heading-1">Home</h1>\n    <p class="utrecht-paragraph">Hello, world!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe BEM class names can be particularly useful to include only the CSS you need using [CSS modules](https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-1-need/) ([in React](https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-3-react/)).\n\n```js\nimport React from "react";\nimport style from "@utrecht/component-library-css/dist/bem.css";\n\nexport default class ExamplePage extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <h1 className={btn["utrecht-heading-1"]}>Home</h1>\n        <p className={btn["utrecht-paragraph"]}>Hello, world!</p>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n'},"../component-library-css/html-component.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports='\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# HTML Components\n\nHTML components contain a small subset of the CSS components, for components that occur in regular HTML pages with semantic HTML. You can apply the `utrecht-html-content` class name to your page, and any semantic HTML will be styled automatically. This can be helpful to style HTML content from a CMS, for example.\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save-dev --save-exact @utrecht/component-library-css\n```\n\nInclude the CSS in your HTML page like so:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang="en" class="utrecht-html-content">\n  <head>\n    <title>Example page</title>\n    <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@utrecht/component-library-css/dist/html.css" />\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Home</h1>\n    <p>Hello, world!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n'},"../component-library-formio/README.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports='\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# Form.io Components\n\nThe `@utrecht/component-library-formio` package contains implementations of various form related components. It currently is a mix of CSS components and Web components. This means you need to install the following three packages:\n\n## Installation\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save-dev --save-exact \\\n  @utrecht/component-library-css \\\n  @utrecht/component-library-formio \\\n  @utrecht/web-component-library-stencil\n```\n\nAdditionally, having the core Form.io packages installed is a prerequisite:\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save-dev --save-exact formiojs react-formio\n```\n\nConfigure Form.io to use our custom components instead by including the following code in your app once:\n\n```ts\nimport { Formio, Templates } from "react-formio";\nimport { components, templates } from "@utrecht/component-library-formio";\n\nFormio.use({ components });\nTemplates.current = templates;\n```\n\nSince the implementation of the web components needs to be loaded in the browser, include the following effect to import web component library from `@utrecht/web-component-library-stencil`, in Next.js this would be in `_app.ts`:\n\n```js\nuseEffect(() => {\n  import("@utrecht/web-component-library-stencil/dist/utrecht/utrecht.esm.js");\n}, []);\n```\n\n## Create a form\n\nBecause the components use Web components internally, it is important to include the web components in the allow list of [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify), which would otherwise remove these essential custom elements as part of the cross-site scripting mitigations:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Form } from \'react-formio\';\nimport { sanitizeConfig } from "@utrecht/component-library-formio";\n\nexport const Page () => (<Form options={{ sanitizeConfig }}/>)\n```\n\nEvery `<Form>` element must be configured with the correct `sanitizeConfig` settings, otherwise the form inputs cannot be displayed.\n\n## Theming\n\nTo use the Utrecht theme for the components, include the design tokens CSS in your `angular.json`:\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save-dev --save-exact @utrecht/design-tokens\n```\n\nInclude the CSS variables in your page.\n\n```js\nimport "@utrecht/design-tokens/dist/index.css";\n```\n'},"../component-library-react/README.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports='\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# Component library for React apps\n\nThe `@utrecht/component-library-react` package contains React implementations of various components. You can use this package in React apps, both client side and server side, to render the right HTML elements with the Utrecht design system class names.\n\nThe CSS components that implement the Utrecht design system class names are published in a separate npm package, so don\'t forget to install and include `@utrecht/component-library-css` too for the styling of the white-label components, as well as a package with design tokens for your theme.\n\n## Stability of the components\n\nThe React components are released as _alpha_ version, which means the components are still work in progress and it is likely that some APIs will between releases.\n\nMake sure you specify the exact version as dependency, so you can schedule to upgrade to the latest version when you have time to test for regression bugs.\n\n## React Component or React Web Component?\n\nWe currently have two packages with React components, and you might wonder which to choose. Our Web Components are still experimental and since the Shadow DOM prevents you from simply extending the CSS implementation, you wouldn\'t be able to easily tweak it to your needs. Therefore we suggest using the React components when they are available.\n\nIn the future this advice might change since some components could be released exclusively as Web Component while others will remain available as CSS component with React wrapper only.\n\n## Getting started\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save-dev --save-exact @utrecht/component-library-react\n```\n\nWith this package available, you can render any component from the library in your page. For example:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Document } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Document";\nimport { Heading1 } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Heading1";\n\nexport const MyPage = () => (\n  <Document>\n    <Heading1>Page styled with NL Design System</Heading1>\n  </Document>\n);\n```\n\nAdditionally you should also include the CSS for the components and the design tokens to configure the CSS components. For example:\n\n```js\n// Package with the HTML rendering of components\nimport { Document } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Document";\nimport { Heading1 } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Heading1";\n\n// Package with CSS for white-label components\nimport "@utrecht/component-library-css/dist/bem.css";\n\n// Package with Utrecht design tokens for the white-label components\n// Substitute with your another theme for other organisations.\nimport "@utrecht/design-tokens/dist/theme/index.css";\n\nexport const MyPage = () => (\n  // Class name to apply the design tokens from the theme\n  <Document className="utrecht-theme">\n    <Heading1>Page styled with NL Design System</Heading1>\n  </Document>\n);\n```\n\n## Components overview\n\nWe make components for React available when needed in a project. Not every component is available yet, and we welcome you to discuss contributions.\n\nCurrently the following components are available:\n\n```js\nimport { Article } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Article";\nimport { Backdrop } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Backdrop";\nimport { Button } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Button";\nimport { Checkbox } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Checkbox";\nimport { Document } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Document";\nimport { Fieldset } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Fieldset";\nimport { FieldsetLegend } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/FieldsetLegend";\nimport { FormField } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/FormField";\nimport { FormFieldDescription } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/FormFieldDescription";\nimport { FormLabel } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/FormLabel";\nimport { HTMLContent } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/HTMLContent";\nimport { Heading1 } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Heading1";\nimport { Heading2 } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Heading2";\nimport { Heading3 } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Heading3";\nimport { Heading4 } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Heading4";\nimport { Heading5 } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Heading5";\nimport { Heading6 } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Heading6";\nimport { Link } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Link";\nimport { OrderedList } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/OrderedList";\nimport { OrderedListItem } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/OrderedListItem";\nimport { Page } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Page";\nimport { PageContent } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/PageContent";\nimport { PageFooter } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/PageFooter";\nimport { PageHeader } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/PageHeader";\nimport { Paragraph } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Paragraph";\nimport { RadioButton } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/RadioButton";\nimport { Select, SelectOption } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Select";\nimport { Separator } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Separator";\nimport { Surface } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Surface";\nimport { Table } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Table";\nimport { TableBody } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/TableBody";\nimport { TableCaption } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/TableCaption";\nimport { TableCell } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/TableCell";\nimport { TableFooter } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/TableFooter";\nimport { TableHeader } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/TableHeader";\nimport { TableHeaderCell } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/TableHeaderCell";\nimport { TableRow } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/TableRow";\nimport { Textarea } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Textarea";\nimport { Textbox } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/Textbox";\nimport { URLValue } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/URLValue";\nimport { UnorderedList } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/UnorderedList";\nimport { UnorderedListItem } from "@utrecht/component-library-react/UnorderedListItem";\n```\n\nAlternatively it is possible to include them via the collection of components too, but be careful: you will likely need to take additional steps prevent your site from also including the code for components you don\'t actually use. Including unused components would negatively impact the performance of your site.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nimport { Document, Heading1, Link, Paragraph } from "@utrecht/component-library-react";\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWhen a project needs a component from the design system that already exists as CSS component with an HTML example, they will create a React component for it internally. Projects that have new React components can let the design system team know and create a pull request to include it in this component library. No\n'},"../web-component-library-angular/README.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports='\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# Angular Web Components\n\nThe `@utrecht/web-component-library-stencil` package contains the actual implementation of every web component, while the `@utrecht/web-component-library-angular` only contains wrapper Angular components to help validate all the templates, and some supporting code to support Angular form bindings.

Add this to `main.ts`:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineCustomElements } from "@utrecht/web-component-library-stencil";\n\ndefineCustomElements();\n```\n\nAfter this you can use web components in your templates:\n\n```html\n<utrecht-heading level="1">Home</utrecht-heading>\n\n<utrecht-paragraph>Hello world!</utrecht-paragraph>\n```\n\nTo use the Utrecht theme for the components, include the design tokens CSS in your `angular.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  "projects": {\n    "my-app": {\n      "architect": {\n        "build": {\n          "options": {\n            "styles": ["node_modules/@utrecht/design-tokens/dist/index.css", "src/styles.css"]\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n'},"../web-component-library-react/README.md":module=>{"use strict";module.exports='\x3c!-- @license CC0-1.0 --\x3e\n\n# React Web Components\n\nThe `@utrecht/web-component-library-stencil` package contains the actual implementation of every web component, while the `@utrecht/web-component-library-react` only contains wrapper React components to provide JSX elements for every Web Component.
